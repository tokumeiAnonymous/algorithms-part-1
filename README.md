### Percolation
Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials:  
what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor?  
Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below),  
under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom  
(or the oil to gush through to the surface)?  
Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations.

### Deque and Randomized Queue
Dequeue. A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”)  
is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.  

Randomized queue. A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue,  
except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data structure.

### Collinear
Computer vision involves analyzing patterns in visual images and reconstructing the real-world objects that produced them.  
The process is often broken up into two phases: feature detection and pattern recognition.  
Feature detection involves selecting important features of the image; pattern recognition involves discovering patterns in the features.  
We will investigate a particularly clean pattern recognition problem involving points and line segments.  
This kind of pattern recognition arises in many other applications such as statistical data analysis.  

The problem. Given a set of n distinct points in the plane, find every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points.

### 8puzzle
The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8,  
 plus a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in row-major order, using as few moves as possible.  
You are permitted to slide tiles either horizontally or vertically into the blank square.  

Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.
